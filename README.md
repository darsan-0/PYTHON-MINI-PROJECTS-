# 🐍 PYTHON MINI PROJECTS

✨ A growing collection of **small Python mini-projects** built while learning Python step-by-step.

This repository is my personal learning space where I experiment, practice logic, and build mini programs in parallel with my Python journey.

## 🚀 About This Repo

Instead of one big project, this repo contains **multiple mini projects** created to understand Python concepts practically.

💡 Every notebook or script here represents something new I learned — from beginner basics to more advanced ideas.
